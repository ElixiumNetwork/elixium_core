# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue  before making a change, unless it is already an existing
issue created by one of the maintainers of the project. Nevertheless, leave a
comment claiming the issue before beginning to work on it, so maintainers know
that someone is working on the issue.

A good way to get started is by looking
through the
[Good First Issue](https://github.com/ElixiumNetwork/elixium_core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
tag. If there isn't anything appealing in that tag, there may be some things
marked as "TODO" in the codebase itself that may be interesting. These are things
that will vary in scale / difficulty though.

**If you claim an issue and then don't follow up on it within a week, the issue will be up for anyone else to work on.**

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the [Development Wiki](https://github.com/Elixium/elixium_core/wiki) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and mix.exs to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. If adding or changing a feature, update the respective tests that go along with it.
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one maintainer, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
6. If an issue corresponding to the pull request exists, reference the Pull Request in the issue, then close the issue
