  ### We start node 2 on Port 8000, and set node 1 as a trusted host.
  ```
  JSONRPC2.Servers.TCP.start_listener(Handler, 8000)
  Client.start("localhost", 8000)

  ### On start up, we call Client.connect to let other nodes that our node is up and running
  # Let all peers know that this node is online
  Client.connect("localhost", 8000)
